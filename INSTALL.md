This repository is version managed via Git, and the preferred way to install it is to clone the repository. If you are unfamiliar with Git, first [install git](https://git-scm.com/install/). If you are on Windows, also download Git Bash. Then choose one of the following options:

***Manual***

Navigate to the folder where you would like to download the repository and open a terminal; on Windows, right-click to run Git Bash (this might require clicking 'Show more options'). In the terminal, run the following command:

```console

$ git clone https://github.com/MargotHTeunisse/tgraphs-supplementary

```

This command creates a local version of this repository, including its version history.

***Using an integrated development environment (IDE)***

If you are using VSCode or PyCharm, these have built-in Git integration, so it is useful to consult their documentation on using Git directly from the IDE:

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview)

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-git-integration.html)

For Spyder, Git integration is currently minimal, so you can stick to the manual commands above.
