The code in this repository was published in conjunction with the article "Transition Graphs of Interacting Hysterons: Structure, Design, Organisation and Statistics" by Margot H. Teunisse and Martin van Hecke for Royal Society Open Science (2025). 

The notebook 'walkthrough.ipynb' reproduces the results detailed in the article.

**Getting Started**

This repository is version managed via git, and the preferred way to install it is to clone the repository. If you are unfamiliar with git, first [install git and Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/install/). Then, create an empty folder where you would like to download the repository. In this repository, right-click to run Git Bash (this might require clicking 'Show more options'). Then enter the following two commands:

```console

$ git init
$ git clone https://github.com/MargotHTeunisse/tgraphs-supplementary

```

The first command initializes the empty folder as a git repository, and the second command creates a local version of this repository.
